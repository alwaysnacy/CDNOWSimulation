# DSA1631_CDNOWSimulation

This is the second project for my Python-Tableau module. 

Using a simple stochastic model of buyer behavior based on "Forecasting Repeat Sales at CDNOW: A Case Study," from Fader and Peter, we analysed real purchase data from the online music retailer CDNOW to quantify the benefits and effects of different marketing campaigns scenarios.
